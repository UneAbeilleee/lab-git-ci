# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch and pull requests to "main"
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'feature/**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
